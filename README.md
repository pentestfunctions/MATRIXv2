# MATRIXv2
Rework using pygame of my original MATRIX project
- https://github.com/pentestfunctions/MATRIX/

1. `pip install pygame`
2. `git clone https://github.com/pentestfunctions/MATRIXv2.git`
3. `cd MATRIXv2`
4. `python3 matrix.py`


Still heavily a work in progress. Just playing with ideas for now, only uploading to get some feedback on ideas etc.
